          <h1>Facilities</h1>

<p>
  In addition to the cabins at the Loch Lyme Lodge, we offer a number of other facilities and amenities at no additional charge to our guests.
</p>
<p>
  Our <b>sandy beach</b> on beautiful Post Pond is easy to use for young and old. The sloping shore helps timid swimmers get used to the water, and our several floats give more accomplished swimmers a lot of fun. We provide large beach towels, swim fins, and a number of other beach toys. We have a separate "dog beach" for our canine friends.
</p>
<p>
  A number of <b>boats, kayaks, and paddleboards</b> are available to guests to use for paddling around the lake, or to enjoy the well-regarded <b>fishing</b> in the lake. We provide paddles, oars, and life vests. Fishing licenses may be purchased locally.
</p>
<p>
  Our <a href="/restaurant/index.html">restaurant</a> offers breakfast, lunch and dinner to Lodge guests and the general public. We serve a full <b>Breakfast</b> in the morning hours. The Lunch Bar serves sandwiches, soup, and ice cream until late afternoon. Our dinner service (Wednesday through Saturday) offers fine dining right in the Lodge. And the Sunday Buffet by the pond is a treat.
</p>
<p>
  We have a number of <b>recreational facilities,</b> including a basketball hoop and small court, two clay tennis courts, a volleyball net, tetherball, horseshoe pits, soccer goals, and a large open field for games.
</p>
<p>
  People often hold <b>weddings, reunions and family fatherings</b> at Loch Lyme Lodge. We can arrange for tents and catering to meet your needs.
</p>

<p>
A wide range of <b>regional attractions</b> nearby are listed on the <a href="/about/directions.html">Directions</a> page. There is a nice one-mile hiking loop around the grounds, as well as a number of longer hikes in the area.
