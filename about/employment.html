               <h1>About the Lodge</h1>
<p>	 	  
Loch Lyme Lodge was formerly the site of a 200 acre farm. The main house was built in 1784, early for these parts, and today houses the summer dining rooms and four guest rooms. In 1917  the farm was sold and the new owners began taking guests. The Barker family bought the property in l946 and ran the lodge until they sold it in 2006. The new owners will continue to operate the Lodge in much the same manner as it has been.
<p>
Many of our guests return year after year with their families. They come primarily from the eastern part
of the U.S. although we also have guests from different parts of the world. We are a family vacation resort
accommodating up to l00 guests when full. 
<p>
We operate with a staff of 13-17 fulltime employees and additional part time employees during the season. We serve breakfast and dinner daily as well as an afternoon lunch bar during full season. We do not have a bar or liquor license. 
<p>
Our guests spend their time relaxing by the lake, boating, fishing, swimming, playing tennis or lawn
games. Many take day trips to the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the Green Mountains of Vermont. 
<p>
The town of  Lyme has a population of about 1,700.  Hanover NH, 10 miles to the south, is the home of  Dartmouth College . Bus service around the area is available starting in Hanover. We try to arrange rides for staff to and from Hanover whenever possible. Access to a car is a real plus. Car rental in the area requires a  U.S. or international driver's license, a major credit card and, in some places, a minimum age of 21. 
<p>
Loch Lyme Lodge is located in a rural part of New Hampshire.
Growth in the area in recent decades has resulted in farmland giving way to
houses and small businesses but we are definitely not cosmopolitan. There
aren't clubs, theaters or other city amenities in Lyme or even nearby.
Our 'city lights' are fireflies in the fields after dark on a July
evening. We like it that way but realize that it is a lifestyle that
isn't for everyone. 
<p>
We have hired European and Asian students for well over a decade now. Our community is welcoming of
foreign visitors. Staff members who make an effort to attend local events or churches have found themselves enjoying many new friendships. Our guests also enjoy meeting our staff. At the end of the summer it so not unusual for personable staff members to have invitations to visit guests at their homes.
<p>
It is possible to see quite a bit of  New England from our location. We are about
5 1/2 hours north of New York City,
2 1/2 hours north of Boston, and 
4 hours south of Monteal. 
<a href="https://capeair.com/">Cape Air</a> flies from Boston and New York to the Lebanon Regional Airport (LEB)
17 miles south of us. 
There is bus service from Boston and New York to Hanover, NH or White River Junction, VT on 
<a href="http://dartmouthcoach.com/">Dartmouth Coach</a> or 
<a href="https://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound</a> bus lines.
<a href="https://www.amtrak.com/find-train-bus-stations-train-routes">Amtrak train service</a> also stops in White River Junction (WRJ). 
<p>
Our full season runs from the third weekend in June until Labor Day early in September. We do hire a few staff members for preseason beginning in late May. Most staff finish work the first weekend after Labor Day. 
<p>
Staff living at Loch Lyme are offered a family atmosphere. A full day off is
given each week and, on this day, staff paying board and room are invited to
eat breakfast and dinner in the dining room. Staff living at home may
purchase meals at a per-meal rate. Staff members
are always welcome to use the Loch Lyme facilities (on a guests-first basis). 
<p>
Our staff includes high school and college age students as well as adults.

               <h1>Job Descriptions</h1><p>

<p>
Here are some details about each position at Loch Lyme.
It is impossible to list every single aspect of each job as requirements
can vary from day to day. We are looking for staff members who are
willing to take on any task should the need arise. We know
that you aren't going to make mopping floors, changing beds, or cleaning
toilets the sum of your life's work. We are, however, looking for
staff who can take pride in the results that come from doing a job well
no matter how small the task.

<h2>Kitchen Staff</h2>
<p>You will be running the dishwasher, drying
dishes and silverware, putting dishes away, helping with meal preparation,
doing pots and pans, and keeping the kitchen clean, including the floors.
You generally will work 3.5 hours in the morning (about 7:45-11:15) and
another 3 hours in the evening (about 6-9). You will have a large
chunk of time off between breakfast and dinner each day. Kitchen
work is very important, although not glamorous. It is hard, hot work
and the kitchen area is not air conditioned.</p>

<h2>Wait staff</h2>
<p>You follow the same general schedule as the kitchen staff.
You must enjoy talking with people and working with children.
Fluent conversational English is necessary.
In addition to waiting on tables, each wait staff has duties that rotate weekly.
These include doing dishes, food preparation, keeping food storage areas organized, maintaining uniforms and some cleaning.
Food preparation includes fruits, juices, salads, appetizers and dessert set ups.
During the break between breakfast and dinner, wait staff can earn extra money by baby sitting if jobs are available.
Wait staff also help with cabin cleaning, generally on busy Saturdays and/or Sundays.</p>

<h2>Cabin/Laundry</h2>
<p>In general work starts at 8:00 or 8:30 and
continues until early afternoon. There is another hour or so of work
in the early evening taking in and folding laundry and checking bathrooms
in the Lodge. This job involves making beds, doing a lot of laundry,
cleaning toilets, dusting, vacuuming, picking up after people, and
hanging linens outside to dry. A good sense of organization and
attention to details is necessary as is an international or U.S. driver's
license. (We provide a car to deliver linens and cleaning supplies
to the cabins. Most of this driving is done on our own property).
Cabin cleaners may earn extra money by babysitting as they are free during
the dinner hour. Saturdays are long, hard days as many of our weekly
rentals change over at that time. Other days are easier, but housekeeping
is hard work.</p>

<h2>Hostess</h2>
<p>The hostess must be confident and must enjoy working
with people of all ages. Good telephone manners are a must.
You must be good with figures as you will be doing some billing and receiving
payments. You need to be organized as you direct the flow of dining
room traffic and service. You will be in charge of the petty cash
drawer for newspapers and postcards. You must be able to take charge
of the dining room staff, people who may be your own age, and make sure
that they keep the dining rooms clean and ready for use.</p>

<p>The Hostess must enjoy working with children. Being able to arrange flowers
is a plus as you do the flower arrangements for the tables. You will
be responsible for keeping the front hall, living room and downstairs bathroom
clean. Some general office hours may also be involved including
filing or typing. Your schedule will generally follow the kitchen
schedule with a long break during the day.</p>

<h2>Buildings and grounds</h2>
<p>You must have an international or U.S.
driver's license for this job as you will be driving our truck and
car. You will be delivering firewood and picking up garbage on a
daily basis from the cabins starting at 8:00. You will be moving
cots (folding beds) and cribs (baby beds) and small refrigerators from
cabin to cabin. You will be mowing lawns and keeping the grounds
in good shape. The waterfront is your responsibility: keeping
chairs repaired, making sure boats and canoes are clean, and watching
out for any broken equipment or safety concerns. In general you will
work the morning shift and will have one afternoon shift. Afternoons
are spent mowing or doing repairs on cabins such as fixing ripped screens
or painting trim. Evening chores involve about a half hour of taking
trash out of the kitchen and checking the waterfront area. Some mopping
duty may be assigned twice a week. You will have a great deal of
contact with the guests and must be sociable.</p>

<h2>Lunch Bar Staff</h2>
<p> You need general baking skills as you will help
with desserts, breads, and cookies. You need to be able to make sandwiches,
follow general guidelines for the menu, make up side salads such as potato
salad or coleslaw, enjoy presenting food in an attractive manner,
keep the cookie jar filled, and be able to figure bills and account for
the money received. You must be able to work well with the public.
Fluent English is necessary. During slack times on the lunch bar
you may need to run the dishwasher and do some pots and pans as well as
keeping up with general kitchen cleaning. By 5:00 you must have a
meal ready for staff supper (generally salads, soups, and sandwiches).
During the dinner hour you help serve the meal and set up desserts.</p>

<h2>Office</h2>
<p>A positive approach and a liking of people of all ages
is a must as is fluent written and spoken English. Office work
encompasses a wide variety of duties including the following: answering
the phone, taking reservations, seeing that messages are delivered,
general accounting work, writing letters, filing, answering guests&Igrave; questions,
keeping the office clean, and arranging babysitters for guests. When
the lunch bar person gets busy, the office person may help in the kitchen.
On a busy Saturday, the office person helps clean cabins. Depending
upon the schedule, the office person may also have the responsibility for
cleaning the game room daily.</p>

<h2>General Resort Help</h2>
<p> This is a combined position generally involving
both wait staff and cabin/laundry hours. The combination
varies from year to year and may involve office work, gardening, or lunch
bar duty.</p>

<h2>Cooks</h2>
<p>You are in charge of breakfasts and dinners daily as well
as preparing staff breakfast and lunch. It is important to have good
organizational skills. While professional experience is not necessary,
a good "food sense" and genuine cooking ability is required.</p>

<h2>Gardener</h2>
<p> You are in charge of the large vegetable and flower
garden. This includes weeding, harvesting, and planting. Weeding
in the flower gardens around the grounds may also be needed. Help
with Saturday cabin cleaning may be required.</p>

<h2>Note</h2> <p> Most of the jobs require working six days a week including
Saturdays. Some of the cooking positions have two days off a week.</p>

<p>Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns about wages,
job requirements, or living conditions at Loch Lyme Lodge.
