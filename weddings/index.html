		   <p>Did you ever dream of getting married in a beautiful country setting, next to a crystal clear lake, with your friends and family in attendance, all able to walk down to the ceremony from their own cabin in the woods? Well look no further! Loch Lyme Lodge in the small Norman Rockwell-like town of Lyme, New Hampshire is your dream destination. With 20 cabins of various sizes on over 120 acres of fields and woods, next to a beautiful mountain lake, your wedding will be the envy of all. There are plenty of activities to keep your party entertained during the weekend, including canoeing and kayaking on the lake, tennis and basketball, hiking, horseshoe pits, and a roaring lake side campfire to gather around as night sets in.</p>

            <h2>Where will my ceremony be held?</h2>
<p>Many couples decide to have their ceremony right beside our beautiful lake. There are other locations on the property if you prefer to marry in a wooded area. Others have chosen one of the local churches.</p>

      <h2>Where will my reception take place?</h2>
<p>Working together we can decide what works best for you. Typically weddings require a wedding tent to be set up in the grassy field behind the barn. A rental company can come in and set a tent in place, complete with tables, chairs, lighting, linens, china, silverware and even a dance floor. (We supply electricity to the tent)</p>

<h2>When do you offer weddings?</h2>
		<p>Because the Lodge is booked with weeklong guests for the months of July and August, we do weddings in late May, June and September. This is the best time for you as well since it ensures that every cabin is available just for your party</p>

		<h2>What makes the lodge so unique?</h2>
<p> You can rent out our whole site including all 20 cabins for the whole weekend. We prepare the cabins for a Friday afternoon check-in, all made up with fresh linens and blankets, full sets of towels and a complimentary bundle of firewood for your guests. You can decide which cabin will suit any individual or family simply by checking our website for its sleeping arrangements. It's fun to have all your friends and family within walking distances to each other, while maintaining their own privacy. There are several inns and a hotel nearby if you need more rooms or you have a guest with special needs. A huge savings to you is that you supply your own alcohol for the reception. We do require that you hire a licensed bartender for the reception itself. We can refer you to bartenders, caterer&apos;s, and tent companies, as well as all the other vendors that together, make up a great stress-free weekend!</p>

We would be happy to refer you to some of our wonderful couples who have had their weddings here. Please feel free to contact us with any questions. Thank you for considering Loch Lyme Lodge!</p>
